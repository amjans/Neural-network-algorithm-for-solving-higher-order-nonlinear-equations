# Neural-network-algorithm-for-solving-higher-order-nonlinear-equations

## Description
This repository contains the code for the bachelor's thesis "Neural network algorithm for solving (higher order) nonlinear equations" written by Amanda Jansson and Thomas Ryd Sternbeck, students of KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. It includes codes for a polynomial solver, equation 4 solver and equation 9 solver from the paper "An iterative approach for the exact solution of the pairing Hamiltonian" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465522000285?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=8852436acf3782d9). 


## Polynomial sovler
Simpler model where the coefficients is the input, and the output is one of the roots. 

## Equation 4 solver
Solves for equation 4. 

## Equation 9 solver
Solves for equation 9.
